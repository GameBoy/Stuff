## AGB-001 Backlight Mod

![32 vs 40 pin](http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/6/9/2/4/4/2/webimg/715988387_o.jpg)

* 32 pin: 1st number is "1"
* 40 pin: 1st number is "0"


### AGS-101 Screen Types (All reproduction screens are Type A)

You can tell the type by the ribbon circuitry or connector color [(source)][https://gbatemp.net/threads/gba-backlight-agb-001.328487/page-44#post-5465938]

* A: uniform widths, white connector
* AB/B:  differing widths, brown connector


### Ribbon Adapters

* 32/40 pin: Must purchase one that matches your AGB-001 motherboard
* Solderless: Will not be as bright unless you add a wire
* Solder required: Must connect P1 to left leg of DA1
* Switch: Allows switching between high/low through the battery compartment. Requires slight shell modification. Physical switch so it keeps setting across device reboots.
* 5 level w/ key combo: Allows switching through 5 brightness levels with Select + L, but boots with lowest setting every time.


### AGB-001 Model & AGS-101 Screen Pairing

* **32 pin + Type-A: Perfect [(source)][1]**
* 32 pin + Type-AB: Washed out and dim [(source)][1]
* 40 pin + Type-A: Washed out and bright (tested). Possibly connect 103 to GND to fix [(source)][2] (Newer ribbon adapters do not have this issue)
* **40 pin + Type-AB: Perfect (tested)**

### Notes

* Remove rubber grommet and backing from front and back of AGS-101 screen or else it won't fit
* Must modify shell to fit new screen
* Can adjust screen using potentiometer through hole behind sticker on the back
* If buying a new shell with hardware, use the hardware that came with the shell since the hardware might be different and the shell is designed for them
* Insulate the pins on the cartridge reader with kapton tape, to prevent them from shorting with your screen
